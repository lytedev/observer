# lyte-observer

A thin wrapper around my most commonly-used crates for error handling and
reporting, tracing, observability, logs, etc.

If you find yourself wanting to do more or customize stuff, I'm open to
suggestions to this repo, but almost certainly I believe you should just setup
stuff more manually in your project.
